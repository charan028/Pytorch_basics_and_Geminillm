# PyTorch Basics

This Jupyter notebook provides an introduction to PyTorch, covering fundamental operations and concepts. It includes examples of tensor creation, manipulation, and basic operations. The notebook is designed for beginners who want to get familiar with PyTorch and its core functionalities.

## Overview

This notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Tensor Creation**:
   - How to create tensors using `torch.Tensor`, `torch.rand`, and other PyTorch functions.
   - Basic properties of tensors, such as dimensions (`ndim`), shape, and data types.

2. **Tensor Operations**:
   - Indexing and accessing tensor elements.
   - Basic operations like matrix multiplication, element-wise multiplication, and aggregation functions (e.g., `mean`, `sum`, `argmin`, `argmax`).
   - Tensor reshaping techniques like squeezing, unsqueezing, and stacking.

3. **Device Management**:
   - How to move tensors to GPU using `.cuda()` for faster computations.
   - Checking tensor devices.

4. **Matrix Operations**:
   - Performing matrix multiplication using `torch.matmul` and its alias `mm`.
   - Understanding transpose operations and their applications in matrix operations.

5. **Aggregation Functions**:
   - Using PyTorch functions like `mean`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, and their variations.
   - Working with tensor data types for specific operations (e.g., converting to `float32` for certain operations).

6. **Tensor Manipulation**:
   - Techniques for modifying tensor dimensions using operations like `squeeze`, `unsqueeze`, and `stack`.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need:

- Python 3.9 or later.
- PyTorch installed (`torch` library).
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/charan028/Pytorch_basics_and_Geminillm.git)
   cd Pytorch_basics_and_Geminillm
   import torch
   # Create a 3x4 tensor
    tensor = torch.rand(size=(3, 4))

    # Perform matrix multiplication
    result = torch.matmul(tensor, tensor.T)
   print(result)
